				<p>Welcome to our youth page!</p>
				<p>
					Our youth are dedicated to worshiping the Lord with all our talents and gifts.
					The Lord has shown through them, and is continuing to do so on a regular basis.
					Many people have been blessed by seeing them active for the Lord. 
					They have an eagerness to participate in activities that promote the message of God.
				</p>
				<p>
					A common saying that has been floating around our church district is "The youth are not just the church of tomorrow; they're also the church of today." 
					If you have youth that would like to become involved, or if you're looking to support a youth group in any way, 
					we welcome you and youth to join us as well as any support you have to offer.
