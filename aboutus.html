				Welcome to the Potash Church of God website - About Us! 
			</p>
			<p>
				We are glad you were able to visit and hope you are inspired to join us soon.
				We are excited about what God is doing and all that is to come. We hope to spend our time glorifying and serving the Lord.
				We are a small church in rural Randolph County that has been worshiping and serving the Lord since our founding in 1944.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal is to serve the Lord and spread His word throughout the land. 
				The Lord has been good to us, and we bet He's been good to you too. We believe the Lord loves everyone, 
				and He inhabits the praise of His people. Even in times of turmoil, God is good because God is good all the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the years we've seen many changes around us as saints have gone home to the Lord, but our God never changes.
				We want you to know that we care about you, and God loves you more than you will ever know. 
				If you've been trapped by a stronghold in your life, we know how you feel.
				The word states in Romans 3:23 that "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God". 
			</p>
			<p>	
				The Lord makes it clear in John 3:16 that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
				that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".
				We believe God grace is enough, and He can be enough for you too. Salvation is that simple.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're looking for a church family, we welcome you to join us in worshiping the Lord. 
				If you need prayer, we're here to pray with you.
				The Lord assures us in Matthew 18:19 that "if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, 
				it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven". May God Bless You Today.
			</p>
